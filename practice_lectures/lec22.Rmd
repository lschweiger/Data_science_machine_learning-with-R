# Using Probability Estimation to do Classification

First repeat quickly (a) load the adult data (b) do a training / test split and (c) build the logisitc model.

```{r}
pacman::p_load_gh("coatless/ucidata")
data(adult)
adult = na.omit(adult) #kill any observations with missingness

train_size = 5000
train_indices = sample(1 : nrow(adult), train_size)
adult_train = adult[train_indices, ]
y_train = adult_train$income
X_train = adult_train
X_train$income = NULL

test_size = 5000
test_indices = sample(setdiff(1 : nrow(adult), train_indices), test_size)
adult_test = adult[test_indices, ]
y_test = adult_test$income
X_test = adult_test
X_test$income = NULL

logistic_mod = glm(income ~ ., adult_train, family = "binomial")
p_hats_train = predict(logistic_mod, adult_train, type = "response")
p_hats_test = predict(logistic_mod, adult_test, type = "response")
```

Let's establish a rule: if the probability estimate is greater than or equal to 50%, let's classify the observation as positive, otherwise 0.

```{r}
y_hats_train = factor(ifelse(p_hats_train >= 0.5, ">50K", "<=50K"))
```

How did this "classifier" do in-sample?

```{r}
mean(y_hats_train != y_train)
table(y_train, y_hats_train)
```

Let's see the same thing oos:

```{r}
y_hats_test = factor(ifelse(p_hats_test >= 0.5, ">50K", "<=50K"))
mean(y_hats_test != y_test)
oos_conf_table = table(y_test, y_hats_test)
oos_conf_table
```

A tad bit worse. Here are estimates of the future performance for each class:

```{r}
n = sum(oos_conf_table)
fp = oos_conf_table[1, 2]
fn = oos_conf_table[2, 1]
tp = oos_conf_table[2, 2]
tn = oos_conf_table[1, 1]
num_pred_pos = sum(oos_conf_table[, 2])
num_pred_neg = sum(oos_conf_table[, 1])
num_pos = sum(oos_conf_table[2, ])
num_neg = sum(oos_conf_table[1, ])
precision = tp / num_pred_pos
cat("precision", round(precision * 100, 2), "%\n")
recall = tp / num_pos
cat("recall", round(recall * 100, 2), "%\n")
false_discovery_rate = 1 - precision
cat("false_discovery_rate", round(false_discovery_rate * 100, 2), "%\n")
false_omission_rate = fn / num_pred_neg
cat("false_omission_rate", round(false_omission_rate * 100, 2), "%\n")
```

This whole classifier hinged on the decision of 50%! What if we change it??

# Asymmetric Cost Classifiers

Let's establish a *new* rule: if the probability estimate is greater than or equal to 90%, let's classify the observation as positive, otherwise 0.

```{r}
y_hats_train = factor(ifelse(p_hats_train >= 0.9, ">50K", "<=50K"))
mean(y_hats_train != y_train)
oos_conf_table = table(y_train, y_hats_train)
oos_conf_table
```

Of course the misclassification error went up! But now look at the confusion table! The second column represents all $\hat{y} = 1$ and there's not too many of them! Why? You've made it *much* harder to classify something as positive. Here's the new additional performance metrics now:

```{r}
n = sum(oos_conf_table)
fp = oos_conf_table[1, 2]
fn = oos_conf_table[2, 1]
tp = oos_conf_table[2, 2]
tn = oos_conf_table[1, 1]
num_pred_pos = sum(oos_conf_table[, 2])
num_pred_neg = sum(oos_conf_table[, 1])
num_pos = sum(oos_conf_table[2, ])
num_neg = sum(oos_conf_table[1, ])
precision = tp / num_pred_pos
cat("precision", round(precision * 100, 2), "%\n")
recall = tp / num_pos
cat("recall", round(recall * 100, 2), "%\n")
false_discovery_rate = 1 - precision
cat("false_discovery_rate", round(false_discovery_rate * 100, 2), "%\n")
false_omission_rate = fn / num_pred_neg
cat("false_omission_rate", round(false_omission_rate * 100, 2), "%\n")
```

We don't make many false discoveries but we make a lot of false omissions! It's a tradeoff...

# Receiver-Operator Curve Plot

The entire classifier is indexed by that indicator function probability threshold which creates the classification decision. Why not see look at the entire range of possible classification models. We do this with a function. We will go through it slowly and explain each piece:

```{r}
#' Computes performance metrics for a binary probabilistic classifer
#'
#' Each row of the result will represent one of the many models and its elements record the performance of that model so we can (1) pick a "best" model at the end and (2) overall understand the performance of the probability estimates a la the Brier scores, etc.
#'
#' @param p_hats  The probability estimates for n predictions
#' @param y_true  The true observed responses
#' @param res     The resolution to use for the grid of threshold values (defaults to 1e-3)
#'
#' @return        The matrix of all performance results
compute_metrics_prob_classifier = function(p_hats, y_true, res = 0.001){
  #we first make the grid of all prob thresholds
  p_thresholds = seq(0 + res, 1 - res, by = res) #values of 0 or 1 are trivial
  
  #now we create a matrix which will house all of our results
  performance_metrics = matrix(NA, nrow = length(p_thresholds), ncol = 12)
  colnames(performance_metrics) = c(
    "p_th",
    "TN",
    "FP",
    "FN",
    "TP",
    "miscl_err",
    "precision",
    "recall",
    "FDR",
    "FPR",
    "FOR",
    "miss_rate"
  )
  
  #now we iterate through each p_th and calculate all metrics about the classifier and save
  n = length(y_true)
  for (i in 1 : length(p_thresholds)){
    p_th = p_thresholds[i]
    y_hats = factor(ifelse(p_hats >= p_th, ">50K", "<=50K"))
    confusion_table = table(
      factor(y_true, levels = c("<=50K", ">50K")),
      factor(y_hats, levels = c("<=50K", ">50K"))
    )
      
    fp = confusion_table[1, 2]
    fn = confusion_table[2, 1]
    tp = confusion_table[2, 2]
    tn = confusion_table[1, 1]
    npp = sum(confusion_table[, 2])
    npn = sum(confusion_table[, 1])
    np = sum(confusion_table[2, ])
    nn = sum(confusion_table[1, ])
  
    performance_metrics[i, ] = c(
      p_th,
      tn,
      fp,
      fn,
      tp,
      (fp + fn) / n,
      tp / npp, #precision
      tp / np,  #recall
      fp / npp, #false discovery rate (FDR)
      fp / nn,  #false positive rate (FPR)
      fn / npn, #false omission rate (FOR)
      fn / np   #miss rate
    )
  }
  
  #finally return the matrix
  performance_metrics
}
```

Now let's generate performance results for the in-sample data:

```{r}
performance_metrics_in_sample = compute_metrics_prob_classifier(p_hats_train, y_train)

round(head(performance_metrics_in_sample), 3)
round(tail(performance_metrics_in_sample), 3)
```

Now let's plot the ROC curve

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(performance_metrics_in_sample)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = FPR, y = recall)) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = "red") + 
  coord_fixed() + xlim(0, 1) + ylim(0, 1)
```

Now calculate the area under the curve (AUC) which is used to evaluate the probabilistic classifier (just like the Brier score) using a trapezoid area function. 

```{r}
pacman::p_load(pracma)
-trapz(performance_metrics_in_sample[, "FPR"], performance_metrics_in_sample[, "recall"])
```

This is not bad at all!

Note that I should add $<0, 0>$ and $<1, 1>$ as points before this is done but I didn't...

How do we do out of sample?


```{r}
performance_metrics_oos = compute_metrics_prob_classifier(p_hats_test, y_test)
```

And graph the ROC:


```{r}
ggplot(data.frame(performance_metrics_in_sample)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = FPR, y = recall)) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = "red") + 
  coord_fixed() + xlim(0, 1) + ylim(0, 1) +
  geom_line(data = data.frame(performance_metrics_oos), aes(x = FPR, y = recall), col = "blue")
```


```{r}
-trapz(performance_metrics_oos[, "FPR"], performance_metrics_oos[, "recall"])
```


Not bad at all - only a tad worse! In the real world it's usually a lot worse. We are lucky we have 5,000 train and test.

# Detection Error Tradeoff curve

```{r}
ggplot(data.frame(performance_metrics_in_sample)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = FDR, y = miss_rate)) +
  coord_fixed() + xlim(0, 1) + ylim(0, 1) +
  geom_line(data = data.frame(performance_metrics_oos), aes(x = FDR, y = miss_rate), col = "blue")
```


#Using AUC to Compare Probabilistic Classification Models

What would the effect be of less information on the same traing set size? Imagine we didn't know the features: occupation, education, education_num, relationship, marital_status. How would we do relative to the above? Worse!

```{r}
logistic_mod_less_data = glm(income ~ . - occupation - education - education_num - relationship - marital_status, adult_train, family = "binomial")
p_hats_test = predict(logistic_mod_less_data, adult_test, type = "response")
performance_metrics_oos_mod_2 = compute_metrics_prob_classifier(p_hats_test, y_test)
ggplot(data.frame(performance_metrics_oos)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = FPR, y = recall), col = "blue") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = "red") + 
  coord_fixed() + xlim(0, 1) + ylim(0, 1) +
  geom_line(data = data.frame(performance_metrics_oos_mod_2), aes(x = FPR, y = recall), col = "green")
```

and we can see clearly that the AUC is worse:

```{r}
-trapz(performance_metrics_oos_mod_2[, "FPR"], performance_metrics_oos_mod_2[, "recall"])
```

As we lose information that is related to the true causal inputs, we lose predictive ability. Same story for the entire class since error due to ignorance increases! And certainly no different in probabilistic classifiers.

# Choosing a Decision Threshold Based on Asymmetric Costs and Rewards

The ROC and DET curves gave you a glimpse into all the possibilities. Each point on that curve is a separate $g(x)$ with its own performance metrics. How do you pick one?

Let's create rewards and costs. Imagine we are trying to predict income because we want to sell people an expensive item e.g. a car. We want to advertise our cars via a nice packet in the mail. The packet costs \$5. If we send a packet to someone who really does make $>50K$/yr then we are expected to make \$1000. So we have rewards and costs below:

```{r}
r_tp = 1000 - 5
c_fp = -5
c_fn = -1000
r_tn = 0
```

Let's return to the linear logistic model with all features. Let's calculate the overall oos average reward per observation (per person) for each possible $p_{th}$:

```{r}
n = nrow(adult_test)
performance_metrics_oos = data.frame(performance_metrics_oos)
performance_metrics_oos$avg_reward = 
  (r_tp * performance_metrics_oos$TP +
  c_fp * performance_metrics_oos$FP +
  c_fn * performance_metrics_oos$FN +
  r_tn * performance_metrics_oos$TN) / n
```

Let's plot average reward (reward per person) by threshold:

```{r}
ggplot(performance_metrics_oos) +
  geom_line(aes(x = p_th, y = avg_reward)) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, col = "red")
```

Obviously, the best decision is $p_{th} = 0$ which means you classifiy everything as a positive. This makes sense because the mailing is so cheap. The more interesting problem is where the cost of advertising is higher:

```{r}
r_tp = 1000 - 200
c_fp = -200
c_fn = -1000
r_tn = 0
performance_metrics_oos = data.frame(performance_metrics_oos)
performance_metrics_oos$avg_reward = 
  (r_tp * performance_metrics_oos$TP +
  c_fp * performance_metrics_oos$FP +
  c_fn * performance_metrics_oos$FN +
  r_tn * performance_metrics_oos$TN) / n
ggplot(performance_metrics_oos) +
  geom_point(aes(x = p_th, y = avg_reward), lwd = 0.01) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, col = "red")
```

What are the performance characteristics of the optimal model?

```{r}
i_star = which.max(performance_metrics_oos$avg_reward)
round(as.matrix(performance_metrics_oos[i_star, ]), 2)
```

If $g_{pr}$ is closer to $f_{pr}$, what happens? All the threshold-derived classification models get better and you are guaranteed to make more money since you have a better discriminating eye.
